##Planning and the impact on our future- why we all care

- Without a well-functioning market, adapted legislation and the proper infrastructure in place, Europe cannot guarantee the decarbonisation of its economy, the development of its internal energy market and its security of supply. The TYNDP, as the European planning exercise, is thus key to many of Europe’s economic, climate and energy objectives.
- Having a European approach to grid planning ensures consistency and cost-efficiency.
- It allows to tailor grids to the evolution of demand and generation, securing an affordable supply of energy for customers in the next decades.
- Reference to the PCI process -> link to the Insight report on PCI
- Expansion of the grid is inevitable if we want an energy transition
- Impact on the decentralised generation on the grid 
- Cost efficient transition
- Reference to COP 21 linked with the European grid development
- You can understand the NDPs by looking at the European picture

##Join us to make a positive change for the future  - public acceptance on grid development  

- Educate people on how the system works and not take electricity for granted -> this is a complicated system behind that requires infrastructure
- Grid development encompasses multiple phases (Need development, planning phase, permitting phase, construction phase) and actions in each phase impact acceptability of projects.
- There is actually two different kinds of acceptance
    - One for the final ‘design’ of a project (if, where, how it is being built)
    - One for the process of taking the above decisions 
- Realistically, there will never be full acceptance for the design of a project, simply because there will always be differing interests of different stakeholder groups
- The chances to get to a wide-spread acceptance for processes is higher when high quality processes of informing and engaging stakeholders are being established 
- Such processes also do contribute to improve the design of the project, meaning a high-quality process also pays into higher acceptance for the outcome
- The importance of properly designing stakeholder engagement already in the need definition phase has for long been underestimated
- However, times are changing. Stakeholders have increasingly learned the importance of the need definition phase as influencing everything that comes afterwards, project developers have learned that doubt about the need of a project is a fertile ground for public opposition against projects
- The process and outcomes of grid planning processes are today often debated amongst civil society, academia, governments, regulators and industry; stakeholders primarily call for more transparent and participatory processes, while TSOs are faced with the challenge of developing scenarios 20 years ahead in an environment of diverging interests and uncertainties. 
- In this context, developing scenarios for grid planning through multiple narratives, and essentially agreeing on a set of influencing factors and their interactions amongst a broad stakeholder group, provides benefits to the grid planning process through:
    - increased transparency on how and which key developments are taken into account in scenario development
    - better identification of robust future grid developments
- High transparency and robustness of identified grid needs is also a precondition for support of those organisations which are in favour of grid development to enable a shift to more renewables 
- It is therefore important to think of public acceptance from the very beginning 
- The TYNDP is a tool which falls into the process step of explaining the need for new infrastructure. Its legitimacy is therefore an important building block to acceptability for the European grid infrastructure and continuous efforts are ongoing to increase its transparency and the influence that stakeholders can have on its development 

## Stakeholder engagement for the TYNDP – how is it being done?
How do I secure my access to electricity at all times at the flip of a switch for a reasonable price and without negatively impacting the environment? This is a question that matters for everyone in today’s modern societies. Electricity will increasingly be key to our way of life, our transport, our communication, our security, our heating and cooling, etc. This is why planning the power grid of the future is of interest to all.

For ENTSO-E, interaction with as much parties as possible from a very early stage onwards is not just a ‘legal obligation’ it is crucial to ensure that the plan is of high quality. It is also one way of guaranteeing that those who participated in the elaboration of the TYNDP will support the building of projects on the ground. 

The TYNDP is a two-year process. ENTSO-E makes sure that stakeholders can interact at each stage of the process. 

__*How to get involved in the TYNDP?*__

There is a bouquet of possibilities. At all important milestones, ENTSO- E organises __public consultations__ which are advertised well in advance on the association’s website – entsoe.eu. Public consultations are carried out via a user-friendly online tool. ENTSO-E also organises __public workshops__, generally half way through the consultation. They can either be physical workshops in Brussels, where ENTSO-E is located or other places in Europe. They can have a pan-European or regional focus.

In order to offer the opportunity to more people to get the information, ENTSO-E often organises webinars that are as interactive as a traditional workshops but that everyone can access from his mobile or laptop. Some of the webinars are recorded and some workshops, events are webstreamed.

Since 2014, ENTSO-E has created the __Network Development Stakeholder Group__. This is a permanent group which meets at each important step of the TYNDP process. It gathers in a single setting 16 European organisations which represent a wide spectrum of stakeholders: consumers, NGOs, public authorities, regulators, generators, traders, manufacturers, other grid operators’ associations, etc. 

The purpose of the forum is not to replace existing ENTSO-E consultations but to further enhance ENTSO-E’s stakeholder collaboration, the exchange of ideas and streamlining of diverging opinions. To complement information received through public consultations/events and the permanent stakeholder group, ENTSO-E also organises bilateral meetings with parties interested in the TYNDP.
In 2016, ENTSO-E has launched several initiative to increase interaction with stakeholders in and outside of Brussels.

ENTSO-E will indeed reach out to regions in Europe through regional conferences – one in the Baltic Region in June, another in Central Europe in September and the last one for this year will be in South Eastern Europe in November. The TYNDP will be a core element of these events. This is the occasion for more regional/local stakeholders to debate the European grid development.

Another high-level forum for stakeholders to voice their concerns on some of the main deliverables of ENTSO-E is the Advisory Council which will hold its first meetings in September 2016. It will group top level representatives of key parties interacting with ENTSO-E. It will issue opinions on the annual work programme and other important issues related to the work of the association including the TYNDP. The opinions of the Advisory Council will be made public. 

**_How can I stay tuned with ENTSO-E public consultations, workshops, events?_**

The best way to keep up-to-date is to register on the homepage of our website – entsoe.eu – to our ‘powerful’ newsletter. Each Friday we send a round-up of what has happened over the week and what is coming up in the next including consultations, workshops and events. This is the first action to take for not missing anything.

If you have want to look for information yourself, then the ENTSO-E website and its dedicated TYNDP page is the place to go: [entsoe.eu/tyndp](https://www.entsoe.eu/tyndp)

__*Who should get involved, when and how?*__
As explained above, all people interested by what the electricity grid will look like in 2030 in Europe should get involved. Public consultations, workshops, webinars and events are open to all. For the 2014 edition of the TYNDP, not less than xxx were organised. Possibility to influence is offered at all stages: when the visions of how the power system will evolve in the next fifteen years are discussed; when the list of project candidates for inclusion in the TYNDP is released; when the methodology to assess projects is debated; when the draft TYNDP is released; to name just a few of the milestones.

The Network Development Stakeholder Group is more about building longer term relations with the key representatives of the full power sector chain and try and reach common decisions. The bilateral meetings are organised to discuss in more details a specific issue. ENTSO-E has of course many meetings with the Commission, ACER, MEPs, representatives of member states but it also meets stakeholders on a bilateral basis. 

__*What does ENTSO-E with the feedback received?*__

Public consultations, workshops, events are all occasions for ENTSO-E to share information and collect precious feedback. The comments received in consultations have to be published and ENTSO-E has to explain how the comments will be taken on board or justify why some comments are not. 

The TYNDP is a collective process. It is in all’s interest that different views are confronted early on so as to have the best decision in the end. ENSTO-E wants stakeholders to feel the TYNDP is theirs. This makes it easier to support the building of the infrastructure on the ground when you know you have been involved early on in the design of the network development plan. Getting infrastructure build to support the energy transition is in everyone’s interest. This is why ENTSO-E is keen on improving the TYNDP process to make it more inclusive and to have an end product that more and more people can refer to.


## Looking back: the TYNDP 2016 – when, what and your suggestions
- The 2016 package represents the third official Ten-Year Network Development Plan that will be drafted by ENTSO-E. In light of the TYNDP's larger relevance on the European energy scene, the stakeholders' suggestions, and the need to increase the acceptance and understanding about both the new and the existing transmission infrastructure in Europe, ENTSO-E is raising and improving the interaction with stakeholders for the 2016 version of the TYNDP.

- In addition, in order to further increase the transparency of the TYNDP, ENTSO-E has taken the following actions:
   - On-going re-organisation of the information available on this website; 
   - Revision of the Network Development Stakeholder Group by widening its scope;
   - Organisation of public webinars to explain to newcomers the principles of the TYNDP process;
   - On-going creation of a portal for European grid development related events, namely a calendar with all the relevant workshops, consultations, conferences organised by ENTSO-E, EC, ACER or other relevant bodies.

### TYNDP 2016 and our interactions

###Your input to our processes and deliverables and what they influenced

- Specific RGI contribution: 
    - Revision of information given in the TYNDP on the indicators S1 and S2 and suggestions provided on how to improve these indicators. There had already been a revision of these indicators between the TYNDP 2012 and the TYNDP 2014, moving from a colour-coded system to an indicative maximum length of line which would cross protected or densely populated areas. For the TYNDP 2016, it was decided to encourage project promoters to provide links to additional information even for projects which have not passed beyond the ‘under consideration’ stage and in cases where it is too early for this, to at least provide an indicative time and a location where information will be published. 
    - In addition to this, maps for the TYNDP 2016 have been adjusted so that the maps provided by the TYNDP will include information on protected and densely populated areas. 
    - RGI has also been asked to provide feedback on the TYNDP section of the ENTSO-E website 
    - How the deliverables were developed based on the stakeholders feedback 
- Improvements in the deliverables due to stakeholders adjusted the scenarios, reworked the CBA, etc.
- How do we improve for the future – NDSG – when need to take a decision it will really help to have the decision in advance (e.g. including of projects in the TYNDP)

## Looking forward: the TYNDP 2018

### Why should you continue telling us your opinion?
The power system is changing fast. Reaching the EU renewable target by 2030 while enjoying the same amount of security of supply and limiting costs is challenging. Putting customer centre stage and developing more and better services for them is a must. Building power bridges across Europe for more solidarity and competitiveness is the way forward. Having the right grid in place to enable this is what the TYNDP is about, not to mention its link to the EU Commission Projects of Common Interest. Who would not want to have a say the TYNDP in view of all this? 

ENTSO-E is continuously looking at ways to reach out to stakeholders as early as possible and to make the life of people who want to engage as easy as possible. ENTSO-E also wants stakeholders to use the TYNDP for their own planning and decision-making.

What are our plans for 2018? Involve stakeholders in the early design of the TYNDP. What do you want future TYNDPs to look like? What do you want to see in it? What TYNDP would be most useful for you? These are some of the questions that will be asked to stakeholders very early on. 

The way projects are assessed is also put out for consultation. ENTSO-E is looking for views on how to better reflect the benefits of a transmission infrastructure project in a power sector in constant evolution.

ENTSO-E will also work on making material that stakeholders have to reflect on available as early as possible. Also a calendar of events and consultations looking at several months ahead should be developed to allow stakeholders to better prepare.

Finally, ENTSO-E encourages stakeholders to get in touch to say what they want to improve either by mail (tyndp@entsoe.eu) or during one of our many stakeholder interactions.

### What are/will be the relevant instances of engagement for the TYNDP 2018 process, where are these different from the TYNDP 2016 

Explain the complexity of the planning this process of the TYNDP -> the concrete details comes later and therefore this chapter shows till a limited point. More info on the websites/newsletter. 

## Impressions from some of our stakeholders

### __RGI__
RGI has been member of the Network Development Stakeholder Group of ENTSO-E since 2012. Being a stakeholder to the TYNDP process for an organisation like RGI which is usually not engaged in matters of market and grid modelling is not a trivial task. Indeed, it took some ‘ramp-up’ time to understand how the TYNDP functions, what it does but also, what it doesn’t do. 

For RGI, the ND SG group has been the space of both most insight and impact on the proceedings of the TYNDP development. 

In the beginning, RGI primarily seized the ND SG as a mean to understand from close-by how the TYNDP and the CBA function. It is a positive development, that sessions which aim at explaining elements of the TYNDP or the CBA methodology are by now publicly accessible via webinars and therefore not exclusive to the members of the ND SG or those who are able to travel to Brussels for public events.

The ND SG for RGI also has been the entry-point to discuss with ENTSO-E possibilities of making the TYNDP more relevant to the stakeholder group we represent. In this regard, being able to develop the social/environmental indicators of the CBA into actual sources of information and away from being colour codes has been extremely helpful. 

RGI was also a member of a working group being established out of the ND SG to develop recommendations on scenario building and stakeholder involvement. The RGI perception is that we are not done with regards to making this process fully transparent and open to external input. Nonetheless, in comparison to the very beginning, important changes have already been made and promising new adjustments are being initiated. The willingness of ENTSO-E to obtain input from stakeholders is beyond doubt, the playing field to react to external propositions seems to be growing. This is also reflected by the circumstance that ENTSO-E has increasingly been seizing the ND SG as a sounding board for its own ideas on how to further improve the TYNDP and the CBA.

For RGI, it is useful to be a member of the ND SG. It also requires investment of time and effort to be an active stakeholder and resource constraints make it sometimes hard for organisations like RGI to be fully engaged. The drive to find ways of being actively engaged will nonetheless remain high as long as we see that our engagement has an impact.  

In the beginning, RGI primarily seized the ND SG as a mean to understand from close-by how the TYNDP and the CBA function. Later on, the ND SG for RGI also has been the entry-point to discuss with ENTSO-E possibilities of making the TYNDP more relevant to the stakeholder group we represent. One example of this is how the social/environmental indicators of the CBA have been developed into actual sources of information away from being colour codes only. 

Friends of the Supergrid is highly committed to contribute to the improvement of the TYNDP and PCI process. This group offers us the opportunity to stay well informed about TYNDP decisions that will affect our member companies. We highly value the efforts made by ENTSOE to improve the transparency of the TYDNP process. For the future, we would like to see further improvement in the decision making process of the group, i.e. information to be circulated in advance of the meetings so that informed decisions can be taken.
