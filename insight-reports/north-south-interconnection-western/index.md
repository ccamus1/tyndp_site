##Short introduction to the region and it specific features
- Situation of Iberian Peninsula today and evolution in 2020-2030 period, in terms of NTC (INELFE commissioning) and load/generation scenarios…
- … highlighting the main drivers for grid development in CSW area:
    - Insufficient cross border capacity between the Iberian Peninsula and mainland Europe;
    - Full integration of MIBEL 
    - Integration of existing and future generation, mainly from Renewable Energy Sources (RES)
    - Adaptation to the nuclear phase out

##Storyline
- Specificity of connecting the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of Europe : geographical specificity, getting local acceptance is challenging => projects are expensive
- Current low interconnection ratio (10% target, 15% perspective, link to the new EG expert group regarding possible target)
- Capacity analysis of the Iberian border
- Therefore need for specific momentum: Madrid declaration, High Level Group, PCI label
- … Lead to confirm TYNDP2014 projects (PST in Arkale, Biscay Gulf) and to investigate on additional ones (generic project), also some 3rd parties arising 
- Also internal grid development may be required
- Need is confirmed in the long run (eH2050 project)
- Operational challenges in high RES scenarios (residual load ramps, need for back up generation, voltage and stability issues in some areas)
- Energy transition requires grid , and the grid requires everyone’s support 

## Detailed Results TYNDP 2016
- Country use of generation and import/export flows in the 4 visions (like fig 4.1.3.3 and 4.1.3.3 in RgIP 2015)
- Boundaries analysis (map of main flows and congestion, EP2020, V1, V4 at least + some comment explaining cause of congestion and which project(s) will solve the congestion)
- Map of TYNDP projects (as in RgIP2015 fig 5.2.1), 
- List of projects and link to project assessment sheets (I guess it is not intended to have here the assessment sheets, is it?)
