## 1.  Short introduction to RG NS and its specific features

The Regional Group North Sea covers four separate synchronous power systems, which internally are linked by AC, and between the four systems by HVDC interconnectors. Regarding grid development and planning, the North Sea Region faces major challenges over the plan period, in determining the optimum solutions in facilitating an efficient European Energy market and in securing the European Network whilst accommodating connection of large volumes of renewable energy sources. These challenges lead the TSOs within the Region to evaluate, plan and conduct projects aiming at: 

1.  maintaining the security of supply; 
2.  a higher integration of the European energy market ; and 
3.  increasing integration of renewable energy sources (wind, solar and hydro) and as a result a lower CO2 emission. 

Looking at the generation fleet of the region, a general trend towards shift of primary resources can already be observed. The key trends are as follows: 

a.  A shift from thermal to renewable, including a nuclear phase out in Belgium, Germany and partially in France. Adding interconnectors to the system provides flexibility and avoids curtailment of variable renewable energy resources. This flexibility is required in order to integrate renewable whilst maintaining adequate power production to maintain security of supply. 
b.  A shift from coal to gas is expected .The analysis shows that new interconnectors between the different synchronous areas of the North Sea Region, leads to large reduction of regional CO2- emissions. 
c.  Controllable fossil-fuel generation (gas, coal and to some extent nuclear) are expected to be decommissioned and replaced by less -controllable generation (wind and sun), which also requires more flexibility in system services for operations to maintain security of supply and (Regional) system adequacy. 

This change requires in general a more flexible power system.

<div class="callout" markdown="1">
Generally to be answered in chapter 2: 
-   Explain origin and consequences of trends
-   How does project portfolio allow to implement the bulk power flows
-   What is remaining gap to further study. 
-   Political ambition targets are driving RES implementation. 
-   Trends, scenarios, needs for further infrastructure
-   Do our projects fulfil the needs, is this enough or is anything more needed? 
-   Disclaimer for indicators
</div>

__Comments to Indicators__

-   Disclaimer hydrological years (connections to NO)
-   Disclaimer climatic years (Wind / PV / Demand) …. Extra studies => bigger range … 
-   The increase of interconnector capacities enables power to flow from one side of Europe to the other, in line with the political objectives. This increase in interconnector capacities is accompanied by a natural increase in grid losses.

## Drivers of Grid Development in RGNS
By 2030, the changes in the generation mix, as described in the Visions[^1], project a significant increase in volumes of RES in the North Sea Region compared to today (especially for Visions 3 and 4). As the generation portfolio evolves, the opportunities of electricity trade between market players changes accordingly. The grid has to be developed in order to support these new exchange possibilities, facilitating the access to the most economic energy mix, while minimizing grid congestions.

The region’s main power flows still expected between EIR/UK to Continental Europe (West-East Power flow) and exchanges on the North - South axis of the Region (Norway/ NL/Denmark Germany). The additionally required interconnection capacity facilitates the envisioned market and RES integration, whilst minimising their curtailment. The grid development facilitates increased power flows between the different synchronous areas and between the Member States within each synchronous area. 

This trend had already been observed in TYNDP14 and is confirmed by the current edition as well. Additionally to the cross-border connections identified in the TYNDP14, some new connections had been identified in the Regional Investment Plan 2015 (violet connections in Fig.1) and are assessed in this year’s edition together with the known project portfolio. 

__Figure 1 New connections investigated in TYNDP16 (violet – additionally to TYNDP14 projects (turquois))__

### Interconnections delivering benefits to the regional development. 

The interconnections across the Northern seas further facilitate the connection between the hydro-based Nordic system with seasonal patterns and the increasingly wind/solar –based UK and Continental systems with hourly patterns.

The development of interconnections facilitates cross-border support from areas with surplus electricity capacities to areas facing from time to time security of supply challenges, e.g. during times with low wind, low solar electricity production or other meteorological events; but also outages etc.). As a result, additional needs for higher interconnection-capacities and improved market cooperation between the four synchronous power systems around the Northern Seas are foreseen.

Interconnectors lead to increased Market and RES-integration and add flexibility to the system. For high-RES visions they support a reduction of CO2-emissions.

## Effect of Scenarios in RGNS
The Region’s market and network studies have identified potential bulk power flows for 2030 across the major boundaries in the North Sea Region, which trigger grid developments.  As can be seen in figure 2 and 3, the flow patterns in the Region varies depending what Vision is being analysed[^2].

In Vision 1, there is a relevantly strong generation share from thermal and nuclear power plants. RES increase is assumed to be rather modest, compared to Vision 4. The biggest RES contribution comes from wind, hydro and solar. Consequently power flows from the North and the Continent towards the UK. 

In Vision 4, the generation shift from thermal to renewables and from coal to gas is dominating. This switch is based on respective assumption on EU policies creating and the economic climate that stimulates significant investment in renewable generation projects – and assumes a high CO2-price. Additionally, RES is assumed to be erected in the areas, where the sources are abundant – i.e. wind power plants are built in GB, solar power is used in southern Europe. 

Anyway, comparing Vision 4 of TYNDP14 and TYNDP16, assumptions on wind energy in GB are smaller than in the TYNDP14, thus also respective flows differ – resulting in different assessment results for many projects. 

Anyway, depending on the Vision, Great Britain is either the region’s sink or source, i.e. the regional flows go either to or from Great Britain, which means projects in these corridors will have high utilization hours.

## Development of the RGNS grid infrastructure
Regional planning explores the necessary evolution of the electricity system until 2030. This includes both on- and offshore projects, 

### – Development of the Northern Seas offshore grid infrastructure
The North Seas Offshore Grid Infrastructure, is composed of various kinds of technology (AC and DC technologies) and of various designs as well. This has already been elaborated in the TYNDP14 edition. ENTSO-E assumes a parallel development of point-to-point interconnections and hybrid projects, combining offshore wind connections and connections between countries. 

This plan focuses more on the Pan-European dimension, which has a bigger focus on interconnection projects than on the detailed look at single offshore wind projects. This does not mean, ENTSO-E excludes the development of hybrid projects. 

The offshore grid infrastructure is already under development since several decades and will continue evolving. The considerable number of infrastructure projects in the North Seas area will deliver significant regional benefits – (table 1)

The projects summarizing to the NS-Grid Infrastructure are composed of projects of different maturity – some will be commissioned already before 2020, others more to the end of the decade.

It can be observed that no matter what future we envision, the North Sea Region has a robust infrastructure, thus the package proposed by the Regional Group North Sea TSOs are fit for purpose. 

<div class="callout" markdown="1">
General working remarks: 
-   [Sensitive chapter! – should we mention the external research projects as well?]
-   [amount of our material is good but limited. … ]
-   RegIPs of the future are the place for sensitivity studies … 
-   We can’t really compete with external projects but have to show where we are good, which is applying TYNDP methods …

## Development of the onshore grids 
- Describe the needs 
- Where are the bottlenecks, what are the consequences. 

The market and network study processes have identified bottlenecks in the European electricity system that will persist or emerge in the coming decade, unless new transmission assets are developed. 

Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the congested areas in the North Sea Region, i.e. the locations where the transfer capability is insufficient to accommodate the likely bulk power flows resulting from the reference market exchange capacities as defined in the 2030 scenarios:

- Central-Western Europe: congestions are spread out across the area due to the highly meshed and integrated system with consequently substantial transit flows. The utilization of phase-shifting-transformers has been applied to balance the flows, however congestions remain as depicted. Most congested in the Vision 4;
- UK and IE/NI: congestions are concentrated along the coastal areas where the interconnectors are integrated. Congestions comparable between Vision 1 and Vision 4;
- Denmark: no congestions have been detected, neither in Vision 1 nor in Vision 4.

__Figure 5 Congested areas in the North Sea region – 2030 Vision 1__

__Figure 6 Congested areas in the North Sea region – 2030 Vision 4__

Table 1 highlights the main driver behind these congestions and makes the link with ongoing investigations concerning potential solutions to alleviate these congestions These investigations are reflected via multiple projects introduced in the TYNDP16 and/or in the relevant national development plans as projects ‘under consideration’. The extent into which these investigations will result into concrete projects and the reinforcement solutions that these projects would put forward depend heavily on

- The firmness of the congestions across the scenario framework i.e. congestions are scenario dependent hence not every solution is relevant in every scenario;

- The appropriateness and added value of the solutions with respect to enabling the full potential of market integration, beyond the reference market exchange capacities. For example, further increasing the transport capacity across the boundary between UK and Central Europe would induce even higher bulk power flows. This would emphasize the role of strengthening the grid in the respective congested areas, but is also a trigger to look at different options to reach the technical-economic most optimal solution. In the example of the boundary between UK and Central Europe this reflection has already materialized in the introduction of a “Long-term conceptual West-East corridor”.

## Development beyond 2030

Given the uncertainties involved in the long-term development of the generation portfolio, the need to implement infrastructure projects must carefully be monitored, in order to balance their timely delivery versus the inherent risk of stranded assets.

Furthermore, novel grid development concepts like a West-East Corridor and a further development of the Northern Seas Offshore infrastructure will span multiple borders with potential multi-terminal solutions and require further detailed studies.

The outcome of the European Highway 2050 study identified a need to further explore the very long term time horizon. The picture below shows some trends beyond 2030 identified in the Common Planning Study (CPS). 
These results are in line with the outcome of the EU 2050 results
