Investment needs and potentials are highlighted in ENTSO-E’s TYNDP package while looking at it from several perspectives.

TSO’s national development plans and regional studies are reflected in the Regional Development Plans. The editions from 2015 present a common planning methodology taking on board earlier TYNDP2014 scenarios, particular sensitivities and planning cases, and detailed grid analyses. These regional studies are an essential tool for ENTSO-E’s members to identify new and confirm earlier TYNDP project candidates.

All TYNDP projects go through a dedicated Cost Benefit Analysis flow, based on a methodology developed by ENTSO-E and adopted by the EC. The CBA results are captured in the TYNDP2016, and present for each project a standardized and thus comparable view for multiple indicators.

In addition, ENTSO-E presents in the TYNDP2016 package a closer look at the link between capacity increase and socio-economic welfare gain at about a dozen boundaries in the pan-European system. These boundaries focus on more complex areas in which multiple projects support investment needs, where market integration (and price convergence) is a main driver for 2030 still, and which deserve specific consideration in Europe’s push to meet 2030 interconnection targets.

The regional, the project, and the boundary perspective are all complementary and help to gain understanding for the benefit and implementation need of TYNDP project proposals.
