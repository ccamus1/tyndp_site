## Which system the Baltic States are connected to at present?

The Baltic Integrated Power System which includes Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania is currently operating in parallel with the Integrated/Unified Power System (IPS/UPS) of Russia and Belarus. 

The Russian power system ensures primary power reserves for the frequency regulation and the secure system operation within the BRELL (Belarus, Russia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) ring. At present the power system of the Baltic States is participating in frequency regulation with its own net exchange regulation. 

The Baltic States’ power system is tightly connected to the Russian and Belarus power systems with alternating current (AC) 330 kV interconnectors. This provides reliable, flexible and secure system operation within Baltic States and the whole BRELL ring. 
Besides the interconnections with Russia and Belarus, the Baltic States have interconnectors with the Nordic countries via Finland (Estlink 1 and Estlink 2) and Sweden (NordBalt), and an interconnector to Poland towards Continental Europe.

The Baltic States share a common goal to increase their energy independence by diversifying their primary energy sources. The TYNDPs of 2012 and 2014 identified as strategic priority for the three Baltic States their integration in the EU internal energy market. 



## What are the main reasons to shift from IPS/UPS power system to continental Europe?
The aim is to remove the energy isolation of the Baltic States from the rest of the EU and connect their power systems with systems using the same technical standards and developing in the same European legal framework. This strategic goal has been set by the Prime Ministers of the Baltic States in 2007. It is also registered in several documents of the European Union. In 2015, a Memorandum of Understanding on the reinforced Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan – the BEMIP - was signed by the Baltic States, five neighbouring countries and the European Commission with among others the objective of synchronising the Baltic power system and continental Europe.

##Has the synchronisation of the Baltic power systems with continental Europe been studied?

Since the early 2000s, several studies on the synchronisation of the Baltic power system with continental Europe have been carried out. 
 
In 2013, one feasibility study – the so-called Gothia Power study – concluded that the cost/benefits analysis of the synchronisation would be negative for the project and has not identified traditional technical or economic reasons that can justify a change of synchronisation from the present IPS/UPS system to the CE system. It also highlighted that there were no legal obstacles to the synchronisation.

In 2014, the Polish TSO and the Lithuanian TSO studied the possibility of creating a second interconnection between their two systems. The conclusion was that the line could not be built because of identified risks in North-Eastern part of Poland. Further checks needed to be carried out to see if the mapping of the line in Lithuania was not creating any issue with regard to land use.

In the beginning of 2015 the three Baltic TSOs developed an action plan “The Synchronisation Roadmap” aimed at establishing synchronous operation with continental Europe by 2025. Grid development projects towards meeting this target are underway. The next step is for all TSOs in the region to find a political agreement on the subject.

The BEMIP working group on synchronisation launched in December 2015 a study on synchronisation led by the European Commission and carried out by DG ENER and the JRC. The study is ongoing. First results show that the cross-border transmission corridors inside the Baltic States are sufficient to meet demand for electricity in the different scenarios studied. They also show that additional reinforcements are needed in the northern part of Estonia and in the South-West of Riga (Latvia). 

## What are the options currently on the table?

Based on geographical location and the feasibility studies carried out so far, the Baltic States are focussing on three main synchronising/desynchronising scenarios which are described in this report:
- Baltic States synchronous operation with continental Europe (HVAC Lithuania-Poland interconnector), and also soft coupling supported by existing HVDC-links;
- Baltic States synchronous operation with Nordic countries (HVAC Estonia-Finland), and also soft coupling supported by existing HVDC links;
- Baltic States isolated island operation, however soft coupling supported by HVDC links.

In options 1) and 2) the question of Kaliningrad needs to be analysed (whether its operation is synchronised with the Baltic States and Continental Europe in one case and the Nordic system in the other or Kaliningrad operates in asynchronous mode). Interconnections 1) and 2) are technically possible and would deliver more power security to the Baltic States. Both scenarios would require additional political negotiations to be progressed. 

Option 3) seems a less favourable option, but provide regulation and balancing of Baltic States with soft coupling support by HVDC links.

## What are the next steps?
The future steps of synchronisation are following:

- June-November 2016: discussions on the results and conclusions of the BEMIP study;
- End of 2016: BEMIP High-Level Group meeting on the decision of one of the options for synchronisation, discussions with Russia, elaboration of a synchronisation programme; 
- End of 2016 – beginning of 2017: additional study on an alternative track for a second interconnection Poland – Lithuania; 

## Additional challenges for the Baltic power system? 

Litgrid, the Lithuanian TSO, has studied in 2015 the impact on the Estonian, Latvian and other neighbouring power systems of the possible integration of a large scale generating unit into the Lithuanian power transmission system.  The study shows that there are no major legal or regulatory obstacle but that a number of issues have still to be resolved at political level. Besides the investment and annual costs of the project seem relatively high compared to the normal investment costs of Baltic TSOs and with regard to the technical and economic outcome expected of the project.
