## ENTSO-E System Development Regions

ENTSO-E is responsible for coordinating and developing the most comprehensive and up-to-date planning reference for the pan-European transmission electricity network – the so called Ten Years Network Development Plan (hereinafter abbr. “TYNDP”). The TYNDP is a biennial report published every even year by ENTSO-E and acts as an essential basis to derive the next Projects of Common Interest (hereinafter “PCI”) list, in line with the Regulation (EU) No. 347/2013 ("the Energy Infrastructure Regulation").

To optimize this massive effort the ENTSO-E System Development areas had been divided into six Regional Groups (abbr.hereinafter RGs) for grid planning and other system development tasks. Division of Tthe European countries in to the belonging to each regional groups are is shown in Figure 1‑1.

__Figure 1‑1 ENTSO-E System Development Regions__

Although the RGs can work completely independently and focus on the local or regional challenges, they are always supposed to cooperate with one another in order to coordinate and optimize the pan European planning effort. 

## The scope: North-South Interconnections

Based on the EC regulation 347/2013, the four regional groups concerning electricity have been established for the purpose of proposing and reviewing PCIs, leading to the establishment of regional lists of PCI. 

The main goal of the EC regional groups functioning is, to reach the timely development and interoperability of trans-European energy networks of priority corridors and areas of trans-European energy infrastructure in order to achieve the energy policy objectives of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) to ensure the functioning of the internal energy market and security of supply in the Union, to promote energy efficiency and energy saving and the development of new and renewable forms of energy, and to promote the interconnection of energy networks.

One of these priority corridors is the North-South electricity interconnections in Central Eastern and South Eastern Europe (‘NSI East Electricity’) where interconnections and internal lines in North-South and East-West directions are included to complete the internal market and integrate generation from renewable energy sources. Member States concerned in this region are Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

The reason to divide ENTSO-E system development RGs into the EC regional groups is that the EC is one of the main stakeholders in the TYNDP process and the Pan-European projects listed and assessed in the TYNDP are possible candidates to be included in the PCI list. Therefore it makes sense to draft the report, where the ENTSO-E regional groups are grouped following the EC regions, and where drivers, challenges and TYNDP assessment results are described and explained.

The PCI process is organized with 4 regions, therefore providing 4 reports makes sense. Also I am sure the 3 regions share some common challenges (not all obviously) that are worth to highlight in this planning report. This is why if possible it would be better to structure your planning report by topic than by ENTSO-E regions, as it would be more interesting for the external reader.

## Regional context

To make the content more understandable it was decided to consider the subject of the North-South interconnections according to the predefined regional context. This document will focus on the central-eastern and south-eastern parts of the interconnected European network and therefore will be a joint summary of contributions of three Regional Groups:

- Continental Central East (CCE);
- Continental Central South (CCS);
- Continental South East (CSE).

## 2.1	Main drivers for Grid Development

The energy sector is the one of the most dynamically developing sectors, and the transmission grid development needs to reflect these fast changes to ensure ongoing secure and reliable transmission system operation.

The drivers for transmission system development directly derive from the EU energy policy goals, i.e. the security of supply, the integration of the internal electricity market and the climate change mitigation through the wide exploitation of RES and the improvement of the efficiency in the electricity sector. 

Transmission system development is a major step towards the achievement of Pan-European and regional targets for the eastern and south central region, especially for the peripheral regions of Europe, particularly for those not sufficiently interconnected to the Central Europe, as is the case of the Balkan Peninsula, which has a rather spare network with limited cross-border and internal transfer capacities.

### Generation connection and its safe power integration into the grid 

New generation connection and integration into the transmission grid is one of the main drivers for power system development across the whole Europe. 

The already ongoing gradual transformation of the electricity the electricity system with large developments of variable wind and photovoltaic power plants, the nuclear phase-out in Germany, France and Switzerland, pump storage potentials in the Alps and also conventional generation connection are some of the outstanding characteristics of the eastern and south central region that will considerably challenge the whole future electricity system and especially the transmission system.

Due to the huge amount of uncertainties in the future power system development, various number of time horizons and planning scenarios were defined to represent future developments of the energy system. Therefore impact of all of upper mentioned changes in future power system is based on the input data used, especially CO2 emission and gas prices, volume of RES; and other important assumptions which differentiate the plausible future scenarios which can cause diverse load flow patterns through the particular visions.

Connection of new generation capacities with a big share from RES shall continue to be a major driver for grid development in the eastern and south central region. Not only the RES generation connection into the grid (see chapter x.x) is the main driver but also the connection and power evacuation of future conventional generation is very important to achieve. Development of new gas turbines and traditional coal power plants in Poland, Czech Republic and West Balkan even though European electricity market conditions in general are not in favor of power generation from gas-based turbines at the time being. Significant increase share of power generation from nuclear energy under certain circumstances is expected in the region like Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Slovenia. 

### RES integration

There are two possibilities how to develop RES:

a.	Connection of RES generation into the distribution grid as a distributed generation with small installed capacity, where there is no need for huge reinforcements of the transmission grid because of the shorter distance between generation and consumption. The possible reinforcements in the distribution grids are needed here, as they were not designed for such amount of connected generation.

b.  Connection of RES generation into the distribution or transmission grid as a large power park, or many small ones concentrated in one area, moreover with long distances between this generation and consumption areas, significant need of transmission grid reinforcement issues arise.

The increasing penetration of variable renewable generation leads to fluctuating and high utilization of the transmission network and a more flexible transmission grid is needed as result. In particular the geographical concentration of the RES development (mainly in DE, IT and FR) far away from the centers of consumption and the Alpine storages leads to amplified power exchanges in a wide transmission area. The divergence in the generation time and demand resulting from the integration of volatile RES is another rising and sustainable challenge for the overall power system, leading to the necessity for additional transport and storages capacities as well as other innovative measures.

Under large RES development, the power flows become even higher and more volatile, triggering the need for further grid development, especially for interconnections. Under these high RES conditions, the size and volatility of the power flows in the region may not only trigger additional grid development, but also raise specific problems regarding voltage and frequency control as well as grid stability and operability. It is also expected that the share of RES on the electricity sector will increase and subsequently the conventional generation portfolio will be changed and adjusted to the new conditions.

New wind power plants are planned to be built at the coastal areas of the eastern and south central region, especially in the north of Germany (North Sea and Baltic Sea), Greece, west borders of Bulgaria and Romania new offshore wind-farms are planned with large installed capacities, which leads to specific projects to evacuate future wind generation. These wind farms are also one of the main drivers for the necessity of grid expansion. In addition to offshore related investments also onshore wind-farms are planned in the eastern part of Austria, France, Southern Italy, what will cause the close interaction between wind farms, existing and also planned pump storage plants require the reinforcement of both interconnection and internal transmission lines in Austria. In this respect and in order to ensure security of supply it is essential to close the 380-kV-Ring in Austria. In Switzerland there are plans and decisions to build new hydro and pump storage plants are being built, which is one of the reasons why the Swiss transmission grid needs to be extended.

Also large development of hydro power plants are expected in West Balkan region (especially Serbia). Based on this fact the specific grid reinforcement have already been planned to evacuate hydro power from this region.

The eastern and south central region transmission grid with all the reinforcements designed has to cope with such load flows, and at the same time ensure reliable and secure operation of the eastern and south central region transmission grid.

## Integration of storage plants to facilitate the efficient use of RES

The integration of storage plants into the grid can facilitate the efficient use of RES. In this respect, considerable storage potential is available in the very center of the eastern and south central region, particularly in the form of existing and planned hydro pumped storage power plants located mainly in the Alps. Further opportunities could be considered concerning development of distributed storage systems within or near peripheral areas with expected higher RES penetration to reduce local congestions.

## German nuclear power plants decommissioning

Nuclear power plants phase-out in Germany, Switzerland and France, according to the assumptions of the different Visions, has a significant structural impact on the electricity systems, especially change of the balances and the merit order of the generation in the eastern and south central region which leads to a change of the load flow pattern. Replacement of this type of power plant by RES, especially photovoltaic and wind power plants with large fluctuation of generating power based on the actual weather can be challenging because of:

a.	Fluctuating generation can cause higher need for ancillary services,
b.	Different location of the power plants. RES power parks are situated at the Northern part of the Germany and load centers at the Southern part which causes issues mentioned above in other drivers for power system development.

The availability of an adequate grid infrastructure constitutes the basis for coping with those structural changes.

## Climate change mitigation
Climate change mitigation and competition will require energy efficiency measures such as transfer from fossil-fuel based end-users to CO2-free energy sources. Electricity peak demand is forecasted to grow moderately or rapidly by the year 2030, based on the future scenarios, where different assumptions and demand forecast factors are taken into consideration. On the main factor of future consumption, an increase is driven among other factors by growth in the use of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Based on the European goals, the share of the load covered by RES will grow in future scenarios. Example is given in the figure 3-7, where the yearly RES generation share on the yearly demand in the CCE region countries in year 2014 and 2030 Vision 4 in TYNDP2014 is depicted. Based on this you can see, that this grid development driver goes together with generation evacuation driver.

## Market integration
The basic assumption of the common market for Europe, which is one of the main European Union goals, is to have sufficient interconnection capacities between regulation areas. Where there is congestion in the grid, the market splits are possible. The creation of the Internal Electricity Market (IEM) will eventually require the harmonization of all cross-border market rules, so that electricity can flow freely in response to price signals. Market integration is leading to more and larger power flows across Europe, it is therefore a driver of grid development.

The main bulk power flows appear from the market integration of RES, especially Wind, in the northern part of the eastern and south central region and solar in the South. The load is in the center of the region, including pumped storage in the Alps. This leads to market exchange on the German border towards Austria, Switzerland and France and the northern borders of Italy, but also causes the large physical flows affecting Czech, Poland and Slovakia.

Within Germany, the flows will stress the internal transmission lines in north-south direction towards the borders. In Austria and Switzerland, these flows will add some stress inside the country. In Italy, flows will converge in the south-north direction to the load areas in the central/north of the country, especially for low load periods with high solar generation. Based on these conditions, internal grid congestion would occur without the planned grid extensions. Accommodating these flows triggers further investment needs not only on the borders but also inside the countries.

Due to the sparsity of the network in the south east region, there is need....

The grid in the south east region is rather sparse compared to the rest of the continent. This leads to insufficient transfer capacities, therefore the increase of existing transfer capacities (both cross-border and internal) is a prerequisite for the market integration in the region. Also, the price difference between the Balkan region and Italy comprises a major driver to increase the transfer capacities to Italy through undersea links across the Adriatic Sea and the SI-IT borders.

In the eastern and south central region there are a lot of projects designed to cope with insufficient interconnection transmission capacities on particular profiles, to fulfil the essential characteristics of the common European market.


## Security of Supply improvement
Security of supply improvement of all areas in Europe is one of the most important goals to ensure an adequate number of transmission routes for safe and reliable energy supplies of electricity to load centers in Europe, both in normal operation of the grid, and during maintenance or congestions situations in the grid.

The energy transition of the regional power system leads to increased high north-south power flows. In order to ensure security of supply and to improve system stability not only new DC and AC grid expansion measures are needed, but also additional reinforcements such as VAR-compensation. In order to prevent a lack of supply it is essential to increase cross boarder capacities between European countries.

It seems that security of supply in the eastern and south central region is a concern for Cyprus which is isolated system and area between Sicily the southern Italy mainland with a relatively low interconnection capacity.  Nevertheless, the major part of the eastern and south central region has a sufficiently interconnected transmission grid, security of supply issues arise. In Germany there are big changes in the productions structure due to German “Energiewende”, therefore German TSOs plan new reinforcements to ensure security of supply in Southern Germany.

In the figures below the current net transfer capacities are depicted to illustrate current state on the cross-border profiles and the map with the borders on which the projects are already designed in order to reinforce the transmission capacity in particular area with its main driver.

## REGIONAL OVERWIEV OF THE ASSESSMENT PHASE

### Scenarios

The TYNDP 2030 Visions do not aim to present a most likely, nor a more desired snapshot of the future power system. They cover a set of plausible futures which allows to identify future investment needs and anchor investment decisions. The development of a limited set of representative scenarios visions is a process which can only be done with involvement of all impacted stakeholders, who all have their own perspective and know-how. a
