The transmission network is made of many different equipment types. Technology advances every day, supporting new project promotors to meet the challenges described in the ENTSO-E TYNDP. The TYNDP is the key reference document for Europe´s future transmission networks. 

This report seeks to provide an assessment of transmission technologies available today and project their availabilities beyond the next ten years, until 2030. The e-Highway2050 project serves as a basis for this report since it captures all available technologies for the transmission grid in this time frame. The reader is invited to read the documents.

The progress in technology has resulted in the development of the High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission system equipment as an alternative to the long-distance AC transmission. The following chapters intend to display transmission technologies, both in AC and DC.

The structure of the AC and DC chapters will distinguish between the availability of technologies and the time by which they might be in service. The report used the National Grid Electricity Ten Year Statement 2015 as an orientation to indicate the level of availability:

Some examples of projects are given for the different technologies and each part concludes in a table to give a quick overview. 

##1.  AC technologies

### 3.1 Overhead lines (OHL)

Conductors carrying higher currents while allowing higher thermal ratings consist of different conductor materials with a broader range of arrangement possibilities than conventional aluminium/steel stranded conductors. 
Therefore different types of aluminium alloys, specially treated aluminium or composite core material can be adopted to ensure high operating temperature and low sag:

- ACSR: Aluminium Conductor Steel Reinforced (reference)
- ACSS: Aluminium Conductor Steel Supported
- ACCC: Aluminium Conductor Composite Core
- ACCR: Aluminium Conductor Composite Reinforced

High Temperature Low Sag conductors (or High Temperature Conductors- HTC) cover a broad family of technologies with different degrees of maturity: while some of them are mature enough and are already implemented in reconductoring programmes, or in the construction of new lines; some others (such as composite based HTC) are fairly young with few commercial installations, and some more futuristic cables, based on organic composites, are still at the R&D stage.

__INSERT HTC IMAGE__

__High Temperature Conductors (HTC) are able to withstand higher operating temperatures, thus carrying a higher amount of power compared to conventional conductors.__

HTC can enhance transmission capacity without impacting the negotiated right-of-way, ideally with minor modifications of transmission towers (mostly clamps and mountings), but this is not always the case. Although existing lines are used, in some countries such projects have to go through the impact assessment procedure again, especially when expected currents are higher due to the increased magnetic field level. 

HTC encompass a broad family of very different technologies in terms of potential for transmission capacity and investment costs level. Gains in capacity can reach 30% for the most used HT Conductors. 

HTC costs are generally higher (in some cases much higher) than conventional ACSR (Aluminium Conductor, Steel Reinforced) conductors. Investment cost figures need to be tuned by considering electrical losses, potential structure reinforcement, and installation and maintenance costs. The assessment of performance over the whole life-time through a better understanding of reconductored lines (models, endurance testing and the level of electrical losses) is essential to further extend HTC use.

<div class="callout">Examples of the choice of HTC has been made for several projects of the TYNDP: the 260 km long 400 kV overhead line between France and Italy, the 80 km 400 kV double circuit line between Belgium and France, the ongoing upgrade of a 220 kV line in Poland, in Belgium Horta-Mercator and Gramme-Van Eyck.</div>

## AC cables

### 3.2.1. HVAC land cable technology – Level 1: Technology in Service or scheduled for service

Today, Europe’s electricity supply is mainly ensured through meshed AC networks. From an underground cable perspective, High Voltage Alternate Current (HVAC) cables are widely used at voltage levels up to a maximum voltage of 550 kV at a global scale. In Europe, currently the maximum voltage is 420 kV.

__INSERT IMAGE__

Today for HVAC land cabling, extruded XLPE insulated cables are the most commonly used. This cable type is available up to voltages of 550 kV. The transmittable power depends on the installation method. Extra high voltage XLPE cables of 220 kV and 275 kV have been applied for over 20 years. Extra high voltage cables of 400 kV have been in use over the last 15 years. The majority of the projects have become operational during recent years. With over 1,100 km of 220 kV and around 200 km of 400 kV cable circuit length installed in Europe, XLPE EHV AC cables are a technology that performs well, based on established international standard IEC 62067. The technology is available for transmission projects.


Looking at the decades ahead, the concept of partial undergrounding of high voltage AC power lines will be one of the most preeminent evolutions of Europe´s AC networks up-to 2050: Parts of 380 kV / 400 kV lines will be put into the ground more and more frequently, thereby facilitating public consent. This overall evolution will be enabled by the maturity of EHV XLPE AC underground cables and accessories. The focus of the technical evolution will be oriented toward the further increase of reliability and the rationalization of future applications:

- The European transmission network voltage is likely to stay in a similar voltage range of 380 – 420 kV and consequently no increase of this voltage level is expected in the future;

- Current rating for a typical partial undergrounding solution (400 kV, 2500 mm2 copper) is expected to increase above 1,8 kA;

- Transmission power of such a system as described above is expected to exceed 1250 MW per circuit. 

__INSERT IMAGE - Example of two double AC 400kV circuits carrying 5000 MVA in total (space depends on soil resistivity)__

### HVAC submarine cable technology – Level 1: Technology in Service or scheduled for service

__INSERT IMAGE__

HVAC extruded insulation cables are also commonly used for the submarine connections. Their configuration may be single core or three-core. Today, AC cables with extruded insulation cover transmission system voltages up to 550 kV and the maximum power that can be transmitted is in the order of magnitude of 1.5 GVA per circuit, with a 2500 mm² copper conductor. 

For extruded XLPE AC subsea cables, a similar technical evolution looking at the 2050 horizon as for XLPE AC underground cables can be expected. In addition, the possible depth for submarine HVAC installations is expected to increase from 200 m today to depths over 2500 m in the coming decades.

### AC Gas insulated lines
Gas insulated lines can be installed above ground, in trenches or tunnels as well as directly buried. 

Since the 1970s, more than 150 Gas Insulated Lines have been installed, proving exceptional operation performance with an expected lifetime of considerably more than 60 years, which is largely given by the gaseous insulation. Due to the absence of flammable material gas-insulated lines are frequently applied in tunnel installations as e.g. in Hydro power plants or in tunnel applications beneath cities.

The extremely low electromagnetic fields of GIL systems, lead to use of gas-insulated lines in areas where governmental regulations or technological requirements limit the maximum electromagnetic field, and thus where power cables or overhead lines are not allowed. The gas insulation does not show any particular ageing in case of increased temperatures, which make the systems resistant to over-currents or temporary overloads, without reduction of lifetime. GIL circuits are particularly immune against external influences if the interconnection of tubes is done by welding, as no / only a minimum number of gaskets are needed. This in turn ensures good anti corrosion protection, tightness and a flexibility of the tube strand. These circuits can follow direction changes by bending.

The properties described have been proven over more than 40 years. The first installations realized with this technology (e.g. the 1975 installed 420 kV GIL for Schluchsee Hydro Power Pumping Storage plant in Germany) still show highest reliability in daily operation.

In later GIL applications the insulation gas was shifted from 100% SF6 to a gas-mixture of 80% N2 and 20% SF6. Besides other positive aspects this mixture further improves the long withstand strength of GIL tubes against internal arcs. Secure fault containment is ensured therefore with fault durations of up to 500ms or more; adding to the very high safety standards of this technology. 
With increased restrictions concerning rights of way in densely populated areas, the use of GIL for AC solutions is increasing constantly. One of the longest GIL-applications in service today is approximately 3,3 km (Japan).

Solutions are available for TSOs through Phase Shifting Transformers and Static Compensator as shown below.

#### Phase Shifting Transformers (PSTs) 
Are a mature technology, implemented by TSOs in Europe to control active power through preventive or curative strategies. PSTs do not increase the capacity of the line themselves, but if some lines are overloaded while capacity is still available on others parallel to them, optimising the transits with PSTs can increase the overall grid capacity. In the future, the focus will be on enabling issues: the development of shared PST models by TSOs and standards should facilitate PST integration in transmission systems. In parallel, the development of cross-border power trade and the integration of renewable generation will increase the need for such a technology to be in operation.

#### Use and expected benefit:
The PST system provides a means to control power between two grids. The grids need not be synchronous. A common situation is where two grids of the same nominal frequency cannot economically be directly connected with AC lines. The VFT allows controlled power exchange between the grids, while retaining many of the inherent virtues of an AC interconnection.
Historically, VFT have been used to control power flow between asynchronous systems but recent applications are using this technology to control power flow between synchronous systems.

#### HVAC Static VAR Compensators (SVC)
<div class="callout" markdown="1">
A Static VAR Compensator (SVC) is a fast acting power electronic device used to dynamically control the voltage in a local area or at an interface point. It is a member of the family of equipment known as Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS). Essentially SVCs and STATCOMs deliver a similar function using different power electronic technologies and methods.

__Use and expected benefit:__

The SVC provides variable inductive and capacitive reactive power using a combination of thyristor controlled reactors (TCR), thyristor switched reactor (TSR), and thyristor switched capacitors (TSC). These are connected to the AC network using a compensator transformer or via a transformer tertiary winding.

</div>

#### HVAC STATCOM

<div class="callout" markdown="1">
A Static Compensator (STATCOM) is a fast acting device which can produce or consume reactive power, more quickly than with AC capacitor banks, reactors or SVCs. It is a Flexible AC Transmission (FACTS) technology, which may be used at the onshore interface point to achieve System Operator/Transmission Owner Code (STC) dynamic compliance between 0.95 power factor lag and 0.95 power factor lead. The design and faster response enables it to be used to actively filter harmonics and flicker to improve power quality. STATCOMs are voltage source converters (VSC) using IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) or IGCTs (Insulated Gate Commutated Thyristor). They can also incorporate static capacitors and reactors into their design but these are typically smaller in comparison with those required by Static VAR Compensators (SVC), and therefore have an overall smaller physical footprint.  
</div>

#### Real Time Thermal Rating

<div class="callout" markdown="1">
    
</div>

## Real Time Thermal Rating

<div class="callout" markdown="1">
State of the art/short description:
The thermal rating of an overhead transmission line is the maximum current the line can transmit without its conductors sagging below specified limits and potentially coming in contact with trees or other objects, thus affecting safety and reliability. This rating depends on many environmental parameters (wind, ambient temperature, sunlight).

As those parameters are hard to measure and/or predict, TSOs have historically used static or fixed rating, which makes conservative assumptions concerning those environmental parameters. As a result, the safety of third parties and the reliability of operations are assured, at the price of residual, yet unknown, transmission capacity.

Thanks to the development of monitoring and communication devices, it is now possible to measure the actual values of the environmental parameters, hence offering the possibility for TSOs to implement real-time ratings (a.k.a. dynamic rating).

The common methods already employed by some TSOs to provide real time ratings are :

- Weather stations or weather sensors: the conductor temperature is evaluated, the line sag is calculated and the limit of transit is assessed in order to keep safety distance with the ground,
- Direct measurement of conductor temperature: then the line sag and the limit of transit are calculated, as with the previous method. 
- Line clearances based on either real-time conductor tension or sag measurements: the limit of transit is then calculated.

Recently, smart sensors have been introduced on the market. Those systems are able to determine the available real-time load-transfer capacity and conductor sag by direct measurement, without the need for any supplementary data, such as load, topological information, conductor data, weather data or other unreliable parameters. The sensor is directly attached to an overhead line conductor and evaluates the real-time sag by analysing the conductor’s vibrations and detecting the span’s fundamental frequencies.

__Use and expected benefit:__

The main benefit of real-time thermal rating is the enhancement of transmission capacity, by providing system operators the actual available capacity on the transmission line, while respecting clearance and design limits. The possible gains vary typically between 10 and 30 %.

This enhancement of transmission capacity can prevent unnecessary contingency like (n-1) actions. This requires necessarily a modelling of the conductor regarding the weather condition for an adequate forecast in case of an increasing load.

RTTR technology is rather mature, but needs further development to address integration challenges.

#### WAMS, Synchrophasors and PMU

<div class="callout" markdown="1">
__State of the Art/Short Description:__

Electric utilities have to face increasingly complex issues in a continually evolving business environment. Two issues of significant importance are standing out: on the one hand, power grids are expected to operate closer to their maximum capacity and on the other hand, there is an increased need for accurate and better monitoring of the network. Something which power engineers have always wanted to do is monitor the phases (relative to each other) of all the voltages and currents throughout their grids in real time. Synchrophasors is a novel method for measuring and determining absolute phase relationship between phase quantities at different locations on power systems. Phasor measurements that occur at the same time are called “synchrophasors”.
    
</div>

#### Use and expected benefit:

<div class="callout" markdown="1">

Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) measures the electrical waves on an electricity grid to determine the health of the system. A PMU can be a dedicated device, or the PMU function can be incorporated into a protective relay or other device. In typical applications, phasor measurement units are sampled from widely dispersed locations in the power system network (such as three phase voltages of a substation, the currents in lines, transformers and loads terminating at the substation) and synchronized from the common time source of a global positioning system (GPS) radio clock (Figure 3). The PMU device assembles a message from the time stamp and the phasor data in a standard format which can then be transmitted to a remote site over any available communication link. Positive-sequence phasor data from all substations equipped with such devices are collected at an appropriate central site using a data concentrator or exchanged between local units for protection/control applications (Figure 4). Collecting and collating these measurements provides a basis for new, very powerful techniques for monitoring, protecting and controlling power networks.

__Figure 3: Block diagram of the Phasor Measurement Unit__

__Figure 4: PMU utilization in a power system__

The main application of synchrophasors is in the field of system monitoring with Wide Area Monitoring Systems (WAMS). The interest is to use synchrophasors in order to obtain a precise view of the system and its limits. A more advanced application is to use synchrophasors as basis of new automatic protection systems which can be local or Wide Area Protection Systems (WAPS). The main benefits of synchrophasors are in the following areas:

1. Off-line analysis: The first application of synchrophasors is for off-line analysis. Precise time-stamped measurements collected during faults are precious in order to be able to reproduce the sequence of events leading to major system events (frequency oscillations, collapses…). Such measurements have been used for the analysis of the latest major blackouts and contingencies in Europe and in North-America. In the same scope, synchrophasor measurements are interesting for the validation and calibration of electric system models used in operational and long-term planning. They can be used in order to tune settings of protections, regulations, Power System Stabilizers (PSS).

2. On-line monitoring: In combination with other precise sensors, synchrophasors give access to more precise views of the electric system behaviour. This improvement of the on-line monitoring of the system state allows a safer exploitation, closer to the real limits. This supposes that many synchrophasors are installed on the system in addition or replacement of existing sensors. Some projects have been carried out on more local applications. A single synchrophasor is installed inside a substation and is used locally in order to improve the measurements of the whole substation. Such applications are of major interest as they allow a progressive deployment of synchrophasors. In addition, on-line monitoring of new variables is possible such as inter-zone frequency oscillations and differences of phases. Such information can find a direct usage for some networks configurations.

3. Protection systems: A more advanced usage of synchrophasors consists in the realization of synchronized protection systems. In principle, such systems can take benefit of synchronization, precision and high frequency of measurements. The drawback is the potential complexity of such protection systems and the risk of common modes and false tripping. For these reasons, there is no real project of such a system for the moment.

However, for such protection systems the main benefit is based on the direct measurement of the voltage phase angle difference. Consequently by the evaluation of this measure and a few overloading criteria shall be derived.

__Maturity and availability:__

PMU’s are used in Wide Area Monitoring Systems (WAMS). A number of transmission system operators have started exploring this technology and getting familiar with its use, such as Swissgrid (Switzerland), Fingrid (Finland), Statnett (Norway), HEP (Croatia), 50Hertz Transmission and Amprion (Germany), energinet.dk (Denmark), DESMIE (Greece), (REN) Portugal, elia (Belgium), MAVIR (Hungary), ELES (Slovenia), TERNA (Italy), Turkey, APG (Austria), TenneT (Netherlands), ČEPS (Czech Republic), Hydro Quebec (Canada), WSCC (United States), West Japan (Japan).

####Limits and challenges:

<div class="callout" markdown="1">
The reader is invited to see information sources for further details     . WAM systems increase in a substantial way the observability of the system by enlarging the classical state-of-the-art system overview based on RTUs with a few measurands outsite the own observability area and reflecting therefore the system state from steady-state as well as from stability point of view far away but maybe also impacting the own system.

## 1.  High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) power transmission

### 4.1. Introduction

Europe has been a pioneer and innovator in the field of HVDC since its modern re-invention in the second half of the 20th century.  Multiple HVDC schemes have been designed and installed, mostly point-to-point schemes using submarine cables to exploit the sea crossings in Scandinavia, the British Isles, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.  A limited number of back-to-back schemes have been built, the most recent being the 2 x 500MW link between Lithuania and Poland.  There is only one working multi-terminal system in Europe, the Sardinia – Corsica – Italy (SACOI) link, although others are in construction (South – West, in Sweden and Caithness – Moray – Shetland, in the UK).  

Almost all of the schemes built in this period have used Line Commutated Converter (LCC) technology.  From the beginning of the 21st century a new HVDC technology has been developed in Europe, known as Voltage Source Converter (VSC), which has rapidly gained acceptance, such that it is now the predominant choice for HVDC schemes throughout Europe.  

The differences between these two technologies and hence an explanation for the rapid change from LCC to VSC schemes are discussed in the following sections.  

HVDC cable technology has been implemented for more than 60 years:

- Initially, Mass Impregnated (MI) Cables were regarded as the preferred solution.  LCC (Line Commutated Converters) were used, implying polarity reversal. 

- In the 1990s, the development of VSC (Voltage Source Converter) technology was considered as an opportunity to introduce XLPE extruded insulation cables for HVDC applications in addition to MI cables. 

### Mass Impregnated HVDC Cables

Mass Impregnated (MI) HVDC cables are currently the most used cables for HVDC applications. Benefiting from more than 40 years of experience in service, with a proven high reliability, they can be provided by European manufacturers at voltages up to ±600 kV and 1800 A, which makes 2200 MW per bipole. Currently, this technology is mainly deployed for Extra High Voltage (EHV) DC subsea applications.

Europacable expects the following evolution for Mass Impregnated HVDC subsea cables:

- Increase  of the voltage level from 500 to 600 kV;
- Thanks to progress, particularly the upgrading of service voltage, it will be possible to transmit a power of 1000 MW  with a reduction in the range of 30% of losses per bipole;
- An increase in power from 1560 to 2340 MW per bipole;
- An increase in water depth for submarine installations from around 1000 m to over 2500 m by 2050;

#### Extruded XLPE HVDC Cables

Polymeric HVDC cables are used mainly with VSC converters that enable power flow to reverse without polarity reversal. Up to now, this technology has been implemented up to ±320 kV with a capacity of 1000 MW per bipole. The basics for HVDC subsea cables are the same as those of HVDC underground cables except for mechanical features.

The following evolution of XLPE HVDC subsea and underground cables can be expected:

- Increase in voltages up to 550 kV;
- Increase in conductor size from 2500 to 3000 mm2, which is expected to result in a capacity exceeding 2 GW;
- Due to the increased voltage, the typical losses per circuit (2500 mm2 conductor rated at 1 GW per bipole) are expected to drop from 42 (today) to 14 (by 2050) W/m;
- Reduction of losses per circuit (bipole) of approx. 40% when XLPE HVDC cable will be operated at maximum power. 
- For subsea cables, the laying depth should reach more than 2.5 km at 2050.

### LCC technology

At the heart of LCC technology is a semi-conductor device, known as a thyristor, which operates as a fast acting switch.  By building a suitable design of three-phase converter, the existing AC voltage waveform can “sampled” to create a DC voltage at one converter station (the Rectifier).  At the remote station (the Inverter) a similar process occurs, but to create a voltage of the opposite polarity.  Thus a key feature of LCC technology is that both converter stations require the presence of the AC voltage to operate, i.e. LCC cannot operate into a system without synchronous generation. It is also a requirement that both AC networks are relatively strong, typically with a minimum short circuit level (in MVA) which is >3 times the power rating (in MW) of the scheme.  If the system is weaker than this level, additional equipment, such as Static Var Compensator (SVC), Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) or Synchronous Compensator (SC) may be required to provide reactive power support to the AC network.  

The direct current which flows in the DC link always flows in the same direction, as thyristors can only conduct current in one direction.  To reverse the direction of power flow the DC voltage needs to be ramped to zero and the operation of the rectifier and inverter reversed electronically and then the DC voltage ramped back to full voltage, but now of the opposite polarity, with the power flowing in the opposite direction.  This can be achieved very quickly, but the rapid polarity reversal is not suitable for some designs of cable insulation, such as Cross-linked Polyethylene (XLPE), which restricts the cable choice to Mass Impregnated (MI) oil/paper insulation.

The AC to DC conversion process absorbs reactive power from the AC network, typically 50 -60% of the active power rating, which need to be compensated by the installation of large switched capacitor banks at both converter stations.  As power levels vary during the operation of an HVDC link, these banks are switched in/out to minimise the reactive power imbalance between the DC converter and the AC network.   

The switching between the AC and DC systems also generates a significant level of harmonic distortion on the AC system, which needs to be removed by the installation of harmonic filters.  These make use of some or all of the capacitor banks installed for reactive power compensation and by adding additional equipment (reactors and resistors) they can be arranged as harmonic filters, which with suitable tuning can avoid unacceptable distortion on the AC network.  These filters and their associated switchgear represent the largest part of the site area of an LCC HVDC station.

Following many years of development, thyristor devices are able to operate at voltages up to 8.5kV and switch DC currents of up to 5000A.  This has allowed LCC schemes to be installed up to 7200MW and ±800kV, although to date such ratings are only required in China, India and Brazil.  In Europe the largest LCC scheme is rated at 2200MW at ±600kV (Western Link in the UK).  A key feature of this thyristor based technology is its short time overload capability, allowing schemes to have significant (1.3 – 1.5pu) levels for useful times (1 – 3s) to support the wider AC network.

LCC technology is highly efficient, with a total operating power loss in a converter station of typically 0.7 – 0.8% of the scheme rating.   

### VSC technology

The advent of VSC technology has opened up the possibility of multi-terminal systems, including multi-vendor systems, both of which have been demonstrated in China. This will lead to the development of wide area DC grids, sometimes called a Supergrid.  This will require the development and industrialisation of some key technologies, including a DC circuit breaker, currently under test by several manufacturers, converters which can block DC fault currents, DC – DC converters and DC fault current limiters. Techniques for power flow control in a DC grid will need to be developed, as will techniques for the detection, discrimination and clearance of DC side faults.  The interoperability of the systems supplied by multiple vendors will need to be proven by control and protection hardware testing using real time simulation of the DC grid and the interconnected AC systems.

At the heart of VSC technology is a semi-conductor device known as an Insulated Gate Bi-polar Transistor (IGBT), which consists of a transistor and an integral diode.  By building a suitable design of three-phase converter, an AC voltage can be synthesised from multiple small switched DC capacitors.  By control of the converter AC output voltage phase angle and amplitude, with reference to the AC network voltage, the flow of real and reactive power respectively can be controlled.  As the DC voltage was originally created from the AC voltage, it follows that at one station the system can operate without pre-existing synchronous generation, as long as one station is connected to the AC network. Thus VSC schemes can operate into weak AC systems, passive systems (islands), systems with intermittent generation (wind farms) or systems subject to black-out.  

As the IGBT devices are able to conduct DC current in both directions, rapid reversal of power flow direction can be achieved by simple adjustment of the rectifier and inverter voltages, with no need to reverse the polarity of the scheme.  This makes VSC technology ideal for use with XPLE insulated cables.  

By simple voltage amplitude control the VSC station can control import (absorption) and export (generation) of reactive power, independent of the power transfer level and independently at each station.  Even if the DC link is lost (e.g. a cable fault) the two converters can operate as STATCOMs. 

As the synthesised output voltage is composed of many small voltage steps, the resultant waveform has sufficiently good power quality that in most applications, there is no need to install harmonic filters on the AC system.  However, this needs careful study, especially if the performance limits are low, and a small filter may still be required in some cases.   

In comparison with LCC technology, VSC is a relatively less mature technology, using IGBT devices rated up to 4.5kV and 2000A.  The largest scheme in service is the 2 x 1000MW ±320kV INELFE project (France – Spain) and the highest voltage is on the 700MW Skagerrak Pole 4 project at 500kV (Norway – Denmark).  The North Seas Network (NSN) project now under construction between the Uk and Norway will operate at 1400MW and ±525kV.  Although power and voltage ratings have risen dramatically in recent years, the overload capability of VSC technology still remains low, limited by the capability of the semiconductor devices.     

The operating losses of VSC technology have decreased dramatically in recent years to reach about 1% per converter station.  Although still higher than LCC technology, the ancillary services available from VSC converter stations, such as reactive power control, voltage control, frequency control and black start has made VSC the preferred choice for all new HVDC stations in Europe.

### 5.1. AC – DC system interaction

A key aspect of any HVDC scheme is the potential interaction with the AC network.  The AC network needs to be able to supply or evacuate the power of the DC link, which may require system reinforcement.  Under certain contingency conditions on the AC network, automatic curtailment of the DC link power may be required for thermal reasons or to maintain system stability.  Issues related to the active control of reactive power interchange have made VSC technology the preferred and sometimes the only choice for many schemes.  In networks with high levels of background harmonic distortion, the low levels of distortion achieved by VSC converters can make them an attractive solution.

### Asset management

Irrespective of the technology solution the HVDC asset requires operation, whether locally or remotely and will require a regular maintenance regime.  The latter, together with an adequate spares holding, will have a major bearing on the level of availability of power transfer achieved by the DC link.  A key factor in the lifetime operation of the asset will be the obsolescence of the control and protection scheme, which due to inevitable changes in technology; could occur about half way through the service life of the equipment.  Thus owners of stations should budget for major capital expenditure at around 15 – 20 years after commissioning of the stations.   Towards the end of the planned station life, increased failures of semi-conductor devices and peripheral equipment and difficulties in finding replacement parts may indicate a need to replace the power electronic converters.  This will be at a much higher cost than the control and protection system, but could effectively extend the lifetime of the asset from 40 years to 60 years and beyond.

__State of the art/short description:__

The extension of the existing EHV grid on the 245 kV and 420 kV level presumably cannot avoid congestions, since this grid will reach its capacity limits and due to the extensive loading stability problems cannot be excluded. Therefore an overlay DC grid is under consideration. Due to the lack of new transmission line corridors and public concerns against the erection of new transmission lines, increasing transmission capacity by converting one of the 420 kV AC transmission circuits on existing EHV lines into 400 kV or 500 kV DC circuits is of interest. Presently, there are no standards available for such AC-DC hybrid lines. Hence, the mechanical and electrical design issues needed to be studied from very basic level.

Some typical AC-DC hybrid lines are presented Figure 5 and Figure 6. In Figure 5 double-circuit lines are shown at which one AC circuit is converted to DC. Figure 6 represents a four-circuit line with two circuits on each side of the tower. On one side of the tower an AC circuit is converted to DC.

__Figure 5: double-circuit line, ac and dc system a) Triangular; b) Semi-vertical__

__Figure 6: four-circuit line, one AC circuit converted to DC__

One major issue of AC-DC hybrid lines is the coupling between AC and DC circuits. At this, one has to consider capacitive, inductive and resistive coupling.

__Use and expected benefit:__

As known from investigations on model test arrangements and on a test line, the limit values of the above mentioned quantities given in the CIGRE recommendation are covered for 400 kV DC, if the conductor surface voltage gradient of 28.8 kV/cm is not exceeded and the minimum distance to earth of the DC conductor is not less than 15 m.

__Maturity and availability:__

Hybrid lines are based on the well proven overhead line (OHL) technology. Therefore the technology is mature. As no Standards for hybrid lines are available up to now, the design and layout of AC-DC hybrid lines has to be derived from existing Standards, plausibility considerations and international literature for DC lines.

For consideration of the mechanical stability of hybrid line towers the Standard EN 50341 for AC lines which corresponds to IEC 60826 can be applied. For new hybrid lines the Standard for erection of AC lines is applicable, since the DC circuit will be equipped with the same type of towers and the same components as the AC circuit. For conversion of existing AC circuits into DC circuits the AC Standard can also be applied, as long as the mechanical loadings are corresponding. Actually the conductors remain unchanged when a conversion of an AC circuit into a DC circuit is planned. In principal, the weight of the insulators including the fittings will be smaller or the same at most compared to the previously installed porcelain or glass cap and pin insulators due to the application of composite insulators. In this way the stress at the suspension point is the same.

__Limits and challenges:__

Hybrid lines with DC and AC circuits more than 100 km in parallel need to be studied thoroughly with regard to the inductive and ohmic coupling in particular when the DC and the AC conductor is close together, as it is the case in arrangements similar to Figure 6. Most probably remedial measures become necessary to reduce the impact of the coupling effect or adequately designed equipment has to be installed.
