## Sharing data and knowledge
This report gives an overview of the data, formats, and tools applied by ENTSO-E’s experts in delivering the TYNDP. 
This insight report is aimed at raising the public’s awareness to the fact that a lot of TYNDP underlying data and maps is made freely available by ENTSO-E.

ENTSO-E believes that all institutional and non-institutional stakeholders should be able to access the TYNDP data. It improves understanding of the TYNDP’s results and recommendations, fuels in discussions on future TYNDP studies and can support additional research related to grid development.
The main gateway to access ENTSO-E’s data is the transparency platform. 

The platform required under REgulqtion offers close to real time data on generation, electricity cross-border exchanges and consumption for the whole ENTSO-E area. The data is collected from transmission system operators (TSOs) but also power exchanges or other market players. 

Prior to the platform, ENTSO-E published key figures through its data portal. 

Data from pre-ENTSO-E associations are still available through the ENTSO-E website.

In line with this long tradition of allowing public access to fundamental data on the EU power system, ENTSO-E is also publishing the TYNDP datasets. There are some exceptions to the general transparency rule when the data fall under some national confidentiality legal obligation or their access is limited to ENTSO-E by contract. These exceptions are regularly reviewed with the aim of moving towards more and more openness. Should you have any suggestions or recommendations, we invite you to share them with the ENTSO-E TYNDP team on tyndp2016@entsoe.eu.

## Market data
A basic element in any long-term grid development study is the set of scenarios applied (see our insight report on “Future system perspectives”). Each TYNDP 2016 scenario sketches a possible future for the Europeqn power system in 2020 or 2030. Each contain the following elements: 

-   installed generation capacities per technology and country;
-   consumption profiles;
-   border reference capacities; 
-   key assumptions for generator efficiencies, fuel prices and CO2 prices.

Some of the scenarios are based on collections of national data. Others are the result of pan-European optimisations in the location of renewable energy sources (RES), in the sizing of thermal generation and load/hydro. A fully detailed overview of the TYNDP2016 scenarios can be found in the [Scenario Development Report](#) which was widely consulted in various steps of the TYNDP process.

Most data used for the TYNDP scenarios can freely be accessed from __xxxx this database__. Detailed elements such as efficiency assumptions per generator, operational restrictions and maintenance profiles, smaller market node data, and climatological data for hydro, wind and solar are not included in this set.

## Market simulation tools

The TSO’s experts collaborating on TYNDP studies use a variety of market simulation tools to design the scenarios, conduct planning studies, and perform calculations for the cost and benefit analysis (CBA) of projects. 

The tools used in TYNDP studies are:

- BID3
- Antares
- ELSI
- INES
- JMM
- Plexos
- PowerSym
- Powrsym4
- PROMED
- UPLAN
- VALORAGUA

It is key to understand this number of tools does not give a biased outcome to particular studies or regions. On the contrary, the common exchange of results, questions and expert suggestions stimulates a better understanding of different commercial tools and possible results. It ensures various input assumptions can be cross-checked. And it gives more insight in the inherent uncertainty ranges that should be attributed to TYNDP results.

The TYNDP experts use the same standards for data input and exchange. They use a common reference dataset (see Market data). This reference dataset is in line with the CBA methodology and respectful of additional ENTSO-E guidelines in terms of IT applications for TSO use. 

All market studies, with whatever simulation tool, are done for the whole ENTSO-E perimeter. They are all performed based on a full-year 8760 hour dispatch optimisation.

For particular infrastructure projects more detailed modelling assumptions were tested, such as climatic conditions, multiple market nodes, redispatch optimisations, hydro constraints, etc. Where relevant this is indicated in the TYNDP project sheets to explain the CBA assessment results.

All TYNDP market studies were directed by a central coordination group to ensure all regional groups and TSOs can perform detailed high quality studies, review them with regional colleagues, in an overall consistent manner.

## Grid data

Although pan-European grid data is often perceive as complex and of a critical nature, a lot of it is already available through ENTSO-E’s website. 
The TYNDP grid data is made available in the form of six regional models (corresponding to the six regional groups in ENTSO-E’s system development committee) covering the whole ENTSO-E perimeter. The models include:

-   Substations with distinct code names, formulated as single nodes, and with indication of the voltage level; 
-   Megawatt and Mvar, both in and out of each node in the model (physical injection or aggregation point), for the given planning case;
-   Impedance and reactance of every line and transformer (without merging); 
-   Lines and transformers reactive characteristics; 
-   Capacities per line transformer.

Combined with the full TYNDP scenario data sets, these models allow for many insightful load flow studies to be tested. In fact, the TYNDP models are ones of the largest and closest-to-reality models available for research purposes worldwide.

Grid data is already available for the TYNDP 2014 studies and will be made available for the TYNDP 2016. 

For anyone interested in testing more dynamic phenomena, ENTSO-E has made available a simpler but dynamic model for the Continental Europe area. The model is able to represent the main frequency response of the system as well as the main inter-area oscillation modes. 

At present the TYNDP planning studies and the project assessments focus on market integration studies and static load flow analyses. But there is a move towards using dynamic planning studies for future TYNDPs ([__link to PS document__]()).


## Grid data exchange and interoperability

As with market studies, also for grid analyses TSOs across Europe apply a variety of tools. For grid analyses the focus on common exchange formats is even higher given the number of data points and their complexity. 

ENTSO-E is investing a lot in translating the IEC common information model (CIM) for use by the whole TSO community. ENTSO-E’s Common Grid Model Exchange Standard (CGMES) is a superset of the IEC CIM standard.

The CGMES once finalised will be applied by power system data management tools and tools supporting the following analyses:

- load flow and contingency analyses,
- short circuit calculations,
- market information and transparency,
- capacity calculation for capacity allocation and congestion management, 
- dynamic security assessment.

The development of the CGMES is a collaborative effort between ENTSO-E, the TSOs, software vendors, the IEC CIM User Group and the IEC TC57/WG13. ENTSO-E will continue improving the CGMES to cover additional requirements defined in the European network codes and/or by TSO needs.  

This CGMES standard is a must in the seamless exchange of national/regional grid models for TYNDP studies. All TYNDP project CBA grid analyses have been performed by various TSO study groups, based on various tools, but all based on the same central CGMES-compliant data set.

As with market studies, also network study experts coordinated via a central expert group overseeing all CBA application issues and questions to ensure all studies were executed in a consistent approach.

## Data usage experience

(statistics on number of times the TYNDP data files have been accessed)

The TYNDP(2014) grid data sets have been accessed about 160 times over the past year, mostly originating from academics and researchers (see Figure).

## Further improvements of available data

ENTSO-E hopes all interested parties easily find their way to the TYNDP public datasets and see value in applying these in their own studies and analyses.

You can expect the way in which relevant data is shared to further improve in future. To make sure it suits to what you would like to use, we welcome your feedback or suggestions at [__info@entsoe.eu__](info@entsoe.eu).
